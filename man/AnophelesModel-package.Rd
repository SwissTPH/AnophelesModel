\title{The main usages of AnophelesModel}
\description{
AnophelesModel is a framework for assessing impact of malaria
vector control interventions by taking into account species- and/or
geographically- specific mosquito bionomics.
}
\section{Overview}{

The package incorporates an extensive, curated database of vector species
bionomics and intervention effects which is used to parameterize an
entomological model of malaria dynamics. The model is used to calculate, for
a given species of Anopheles mosquitoes,
the reductions on vectorial capacity by various vector control interventions.
The AnophelesModel package can be thus used to compare vector control
intervention impact across different Anopheles mosquito species and thus
help prioritizing interventions according to local entomological
characteristics.
