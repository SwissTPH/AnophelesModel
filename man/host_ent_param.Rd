\title{Host-specific estimated parameters for the entomological model of
malaria transmission}
\format{
A \code{data frame} with 5 columns consisting of:
\itemize{
\item \code{species name:} name of the mosquito species
\item \code{probability:} probabilities that a mosquito completes the next
stage of the oviposition cycle in one night, conditional on having reached
that stage. Can only be one of the following:
PBi(probability that a mosquito bites host of type i), PCi(probability that a
mosquito finds a resting place after biting a host of type i), PDi
(probability that a mosquito survives the resting phase after
biting a host of type i), PEi(probability that a mosquito lays eggs and
returns to host-seeking after biting a host of type i), Kvi(proportion of
susceptible mosquitoes that become infected after biting a host of type i)
\item \code{host_type_1:} value of the probability for host type 1 (humans
protected by the intervention)
\item \code{host_type_2:} value of the probability for host type 2 (humans
not protected by any intervention)
\item \code{host_type_3:} value of the probability for host type 3 (animals)
}

host-specific entomological parameters

\description{
This data object contains for each of the three host types (humans
protected by interventions, non-protected humans, and animals) estimated
parameters for the entomological model of malaria transmission.
